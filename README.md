MP Neuron and Perceptron

MP Neuron and Perceptron are linear models and should not be applied on non-linearly separable data as they give very less accuracy. 
Eventhough little knowledge of these models is important as these are the building blocks of many deep complex networks.

DISCLAIMER:
The dataset used in abovee two cases is a private data set, although I've provided glimpse of it in Perceptron file, so if anyone wantss to better understand the models can refer to .head() function call in Perceptron model.
